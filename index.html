      <h1>Poetry</h1>
      <p>
        North Valleys Library | 1075 N Hills Blvd, Reno, NV 89506<br>
        May 15 - July 15, 2023 | Reception: June 21, 2023 @ 5PM-6:45PM<br>
      </p>
      <p>
        It is a funny thing to title an art show “Poetry.” Is “Poetry” the best one word poem? Poe it tree. 
        Maybe since the art show is in a library, that has something to do with it. Poetry is one of the 
        hardest easy things to do, like making a readymade. Combining words and phrases almost like out of 
        thin air. Someone must have said that the world is a stage. Maybe it’s a page? In a magazine? On a 
        screen? Sometimes your words may not be your own. Thinking about the right words to say, it’s hard 
        to remember your lines. React, as if they were written for you to spell out. Silent, as if what 
        you see is best left unexplained. Every word could be the last. Impact, cut to black.
