          More Light No More<br>

          A new restaurant, well, less of a restaurant more of a coffee shop, but they serve food. Everything is new, 
          plastic, modern, minimalist, everything is white. Exposed nuts, and bolts. It doesn’t match the neighborhood 
          that it was blitzkrieged into. The employees nice and aloof. Customers? Don’t know, don’t care. Countertops, 
          floors, furniture, and dinnerware are spotless, no stains, no scratches. One year later, marks, scuffs, divots 
          permanent damage on purpose, on accident, from use, and from the lack of deep cleaning. The result of thinking 
          what it will look like brand new, not when it is aged with time.

          Dear Friend,<br><br>
          I write to you to let you know that everything I say, I mean. Centuries, decades, years, months, hours, minutes, 
          seconds go by without it being opposite days. Perceived time is not like light, happening all at once. My mind 
          does not consist of numerous memories and future daydreams. I don’t recollect on visions of my childhood toys, 
          smiling faces, light beams through clouds, windy tree limbs, the things in between cracks, floating bodies of water. 
          Everything remembered in the past does not look like a home movie. I do get upset if you call a digital movie a film.<br><br>
          Well wishes,<br>
          Friend
        </p>

          He: So what is Ruby Ridge all about?<br>
          She: Well this guy was like living off the grid with his family and the federal government came after him for selling 
          guns to a, um, like a neo-nazi that was an undercover agent. He failed to show up to court for the gun charges, because 
          they couldn’t contact him, and he didn’t trust the letters he was getting. They, um, ended up going after his cabin 
          with a warrant to arrest him. They shot at each other, and the government agents killed his wife and son.<br><br>
          He: Woah okay, so the feds like messed up?<br>
          She: Yeah, I don’t know like he wasn’t doing anything wrong, well I guess he hated the government, and his neighbors, 
          and had illegal guns and was probably a racist. I don’t know maybe they twisted the story to make him look bad, so 
          the government doesn’t look bad.<br><br>
          <i>Luke Combs “Broke My Heart” plays in the background</i><br><br>
          He: Is this the same as the Unabomber?<br>
          She: Kind of yeah. The Unabomber was doing what the Ruby Ridge guy was doing but he ended up killing people on purpose 
          as a statement. Waco happened like 6 months after Ruby Ridge, then the Oklahoma City bombing, and then the Unabomber.<br><br>
          He: Something must have been in the air. So it’s not a great idea to want to be some survivalist hermit?<br>
          She: Well it’s strange that the government has attempts to stop people from living that lifestyle. Lack of control over the 
          population, I don’t know. Almost impossible to be really off the grid these days.<br><br>
          He: I think I could live off the grid.<br>
          She: No, you couldn’t you like the internet and 7-11 too much.
